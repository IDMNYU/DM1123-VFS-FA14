## PROJECT: INTERFACE
Using a combination of Illustrator, Photoshop, and/or InDesign, apply your brand to an interface of your choice (game, website, mobile application, etc).

*If you are NOT creating an interface in one of your other classes or as a personal project, I’d suggest doing a data visualization (AKA The Quantified Self) project. Popular tools for data visualizations are: D3.js and Gephi.
SIGN UP FOR A FREE DAYTUM.COM ACCOUNT OR BUY THE REPORTER APP, http://www.reporter-app.com, by Nicholas Felton to start generating personal data.
Start collecting data on interesting facets about your life. Think outside the box. Don’t go for the obvious. Try to figure out what subject matter would appeal to your target audience. What kind of emotions are you trying to evoke?
Starting this week, enter data on a weekly basis, at the very least; preferably, daily.*

#### INTERFACE Wireframes    
Post on your class website in grayscale (includes black and white) with interface-wireframes category. 
* Create a wireframe of your interface in letter dimensions (8 1/2 x 11). 
* If you are doing a website, you also need to include a sitemap in grayscale (includes black and white) with interface-wireframes category. 
* Every, single element needs to be accounted for including controls, text, images, videos, and supporting graphics. 
* Do not use Lorem Ipsum for text.

#### INTERFACE High-Fidelity Prototypes  
* Post on your class website as a grid gallery with lightbox functionality in color and inteface-prototypes category. 
* Create 3 different versions of your interface as high fidelity prototypes in color

#### INTERFACE Final 
* Post on your class website as a grid gallery with lightbox functionality in color and inteface-final category. 
* Refine selection
