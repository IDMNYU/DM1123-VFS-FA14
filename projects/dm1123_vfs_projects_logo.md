## PROJECT: LOGO
Create a logo for your selected brand in Adobe Illustrator.
* Select a brand that is personal to you in some way. 
* It could be your own, a friend’s, or a family member’s. 
* Throughout the semester, we’ll be investigating ways to visually communicate this brand, through creating an identity system which will consist of a logo, an interface, and a physical application.

####LOGO 1st Draft  
Post on your class website as a grid gallery with lightbox functionality in black & white and logo1 category:
* At least 10 different versions of logo iterations of your selected brand
* One logo per 8 1/2 x 11 (letter) dimensions for a total of at least 20 images
* (a big version vs. a tiny version (a little bigger than postage size) in the corner)
* at least 3 should be digital
* at least 3 should be haptic (non-digital) 
* Also, consider creating haptic / digital combos
* To comprise, your different versions: play around with creating logotypes, ideograms, pictograms, characters, and/or letter marks
* It could also be a redesign of an existing personal logo. If so, please post the original logo as well

#### LOGO 2nd Draft  
Post on your class website as a grid gallery with lightbox functionality in black & white or color and logo2 category:
* At least 5 different variations of logo iterations based on each version selected in the previous class crit.
* One logo per letter dimensions ( 8 1/2 x 11) for a total of at least 5 images
* (a big version vs. a tiny version (a little bigger than postage size) in the corner)

#### LOGO Final  
Post on your class website as a grid gallery with lightbox functionality in color and logofinal category:
* your final logo.
* In order to come to your final logo, you will have to do many more iterations of your selected logo version(s). I would like to see the iterations you made to get to your final logo, as well.
